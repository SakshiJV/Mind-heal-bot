# Mind-heal-bot

Mental health matters a lot. Mental health is a most important issue of concern that is never paid enough attention to. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life. So I decided to make a mental therapist bot, which I would name "Mind-Heal" this mental health chatbot will provide self-help chat through text messages which would help patients to manage their mental health. The timely intervention by this chatbot will help patients to change the way they think and behave by encouraging the patient to reframe their negative thoughts into positive ones.

Benefits of this bot to patients
1)Time flexibility:- Patients can now have a very quick appointment with Bot without any time delay or waiting for an appointment with a real doctor. This means patients can have treatment right then and there when they start feeling low or depressed.
2)Comfort of talking:- Patient can talk all their heart, they can discuss all their problems without fear of being judged by some person, this makes the job easy for a bot to help such patients to give quick solutions and guidance regarding their mental health problems.
3)Cost-effectiveness:- Since a doctor is not personally attending to patients the costs or the expenses charged to and patient for treatment, are comparatively low. 

Benefits of this bot to doctors
1)Saving time and effort:- Implementing a bot that would handle all the minor patients, will save doctors time and effort. Doctors will be able to focus on the really serious patients and can study the cases of serious patients of well.
2)Fast and accurate analysis of a patient's mental condition:- Doctors would be able to exactly analyze the mindset of their patients such as their likes and dislike and this all can be done because of data created and collected by this mental health chatbot.
3)The doctor would be able to know the seriousness of the patient's mental health and would be able to give treatment to patients accordingly with accurate and powerful treatments as soon as possible.

Working of Mind-heal-bot.
Mind heal bot is a QNA BOT made using azure cognitive services. As soon as the patient approaches this bot, the bot will try to understand, what is the exact problem of the patient, with the help of Azure cognitive services. The bot will then look into the Knowledge base (data base) provided by the doctor to decide, "what would be the accurate reply, which is to be given to the patient". The bot will then send a reply by text and guide the patient regarding their mental health, using Azure cognitive services. But if the bot finds the problem mentioned by the patient is not in its database then the patient can ask for real doctor,then patient would be given the information of real doctor.
